* Within Dispatcharr, a single channel can be composed of multiple streams. The system initiates playback using the first stream listed in the channel. According to the configured [Proxy Settings](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#proxy-settings), Dispatcharr monitors for buffering and, if detected, automatically switches to the next stream in the channel. This process of monitoring and switching continues until all streams are exhausted, ensuring consistent playback quality. <span id="fallback-streams"></span> [<i data-lucide="link" style="color: Grey; width: 18px;"></i>](#fallback-streams)
* For each stream listed within a channel, Dispatcharr will display the source of the stream as defined in the M3U & EPG Manager, a direct link to stream, and an option to preview the stream <i data-lucide="eye" style="color: LightSkyBlue; width: 18px;"></i> .
    * Dispatcharr gathers statistics for each stream provided that a compatible [Stream Profile](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#stream-profiles) is used. Once captured, [stats](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#stats) such as video resolution, frames per second, video encoder format, audio format, audio codec, and stream bitrate will be displayed.  For each captured stream, clicking 'Show Advanced Options' provides even more detail on the quality of source stream.

		!!! note "Note for Custom VLC"
		    VLC can only output information it is affecting, so stats will depend on your [custom parameters](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help/)
		
        !!! info "Info <span id="current-speed"></span> [<i data-lucide="link" style="color: Grey; width: 18px;"></i>](#curent-speed)"
            The Current Speed stat is essentially a calculation of current FPS vs source FPS. When it drops below 1 you know there will be buffering. 
        
	* Stream bitrate (current and average)
	* Stream total data served
	* Number of watchers

## Integrations

### Connections
From the Connections page you can create and manage event-driven webhooks and script execution

Click <i data-lucide="square-plus" style="color: White; width: 18px;"></i> New Connection to create a new webhook or event-driven script execution

* Supports multiple event types including:
    * Channel lifecycle (start, stop, reconnect, error, failover)
    * Stream operations (switch), 
    * Recording events (start, end)
    * Data refreshes (EPG, M3U)
    * Client activity (connect, disconnect) 

Event data is available as environment variables in scripts (prefixed with DISPATCHARR_), POST payloads for webhooks, and plugin execution payloads

!!! info
    Scripts should be placed in `data/scripts` and must be given execute permissions

??? example "Example Script (click to see)"
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import requests
    import json
    import os
    import re

    webhook_url = ""

    message = ["Test event from Dispatcharr!"]

    for key, value in os.environ.items():
    #    if not re.search(r"DISPATCHARR_", key):
    #        continue

        key = key.replace("DISPATCHARR_", "").replace("_", " ").lower()
        message.append(f"{key} = {value}")

    # The data to be sent in the POST request
    # 'content' is the key for a basic message.
    # Please leave this thats how the project works!
    data = {
        "content": "\n".join(message)
    }

    # The headers to specify the content type
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Send the POST request
    response = requests.post(webhook_url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print("Message sent successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send message. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        print(response.text)
    ```

## System

### Users
From the Users page you can create and manage all Dispatcharr users. There are 3 types of users:

1. Admin
	* Has total access in Dispatcharr
    * XC login enabled only if an XC Password is set for the user
2. Standard User
	* Has access to Dispatcharr UI, but only the Channels, TV Guide, and Settings pages
	* May allow access to all Channel Profiles or restrict to a subset
	* In Settings, only able to change UI settings
	* XC login enabled only if an XC Password is set for the user
    * Optionally hide channels marked as "Mature Content" in user settings
3. Streamer
	* No access to the Dispatcharr UI
	* This user level is for XC login only
    * Optionally hide channels marked as "Mature Content" in user settings

### Logo Manager
From the Logo Manager page you can upload and manage logos.  
!!! info
    Dispatcharr will also automatically scan `/data/logos` for existing files

### Settings

#### UI Settings
* Table Size - Set the size of the channel rows in "Channels"
* Pin Table Headers - Toggles whether to keep table headers visible when scrolling
* Date format - Set the display of dates to either Day/Month/Year or Month/Day/Year
* Time format - Set the display of time to either 12 hour or 24 hour format

#### DVR
* Enable Comskip (remove commercials after recording) - Toggle on or off
* Custom comskip.ini path - Enter a custom path or leave blank to use the built-in defaults.
* Select comskip.ini - Click this button to select, upload, and use a custom comskip.ini to dispatcharr
* Start early (minutes) - Begin recording this many minutes before the scheduled start.
* End late (minutes) - Continue recording this many minutes after the scheduled end.
* TV Path Template - Supports `{show}`, `{season}`, `{episode}`, `{sub_title}`, `{channel}`, `{year}`, `{start}`, `{end}`. Use format specifiers like `{season:02d}`. Relative paths are under your library dir.
* TV Fallback Template - Template used when an episode has no season/episode. Supports `{show}`, `{start}`, `{end}`, `{channel}`, `{year}`.
* Movie Path Template - Supports `{title}`, `{year}`, `{channel}`, `{start}`, `{end}`. Relative paths are under your library dir.
* Movie Fallback Template - Template used when movie metadata is incomplete. Supports `{start}`, `{end}`, `{channel}`.

#### Stream Settings
* Default User-Agent - Set the default User-Agent
* Default Stream Profile - Set the default Stream Profile
* Preferred Region - Set your preferred region
* Auto Import Mapped Files - Toggle on/off auto-importing of M3U files or EPG xml data from /data/epgs and/or /data/m3us
* M3U Hash Key - Set how to hash your M3U. This affects the Stale stream cleanup.
    * The default setting hashes on URL. Available options include:
        * Name
        * URL - For XC accounts, the stream hash uses the stable stream_id instead of the URL when hashing, ensuring XC streams maintain their identity and channel associations even when account credentials or server URLs change
        * TVG-ID
        * M3U ID
        * Group
	* The original stream will disappear from Dispatcharr according to your Stale Stream Retention (days) setting for your M3U account
	!!! note
	    Make sure to click the `Save` button after making any changes to the M3U Hash Key.
    !!! example
        Your provider regularly changes the names of certain PPV streams, but you have channels set up for these streams and don't want the stream to be deleted due to stale stream cleanup. Since the provider is changing the stream name, but not the URL or TVG-ID, you set your M3U hash key to `URL` and `TVG-ID` only

#### System settings
Configure how many system events (channel start/stop, buffering, etc.) to keep in the database. Events are displayed on the Stats page.

* Maximum System Events - Number of events to retain (minimum: 10, maximum: 1000)
	
#### User-Agents
In the context of IPTV, a user agent is a string of text that identifies the client application (e.g., a player like Kodi or VLC) to the IPTV server. It's included in the HTTP headers of requests sent by the client to the server, informing the server about the type of device and software used to access the IPTV stream. Default Dispatcharr User-Agents are available for VLC, Chrome, and TiviMate.  

* Add your own User-Agent by clicking the "<i data-lucide="square-plus" style="color: White; width: 18px;"></i> Add User-Agent" button on the Settings page
    * Name - a name for your user-agent
	* User-Agent - The text to include for your user-agent string
	* Description - (Optional) a description of the user-agent for your own use

* There are 5 default stream profiles with the ability to create your own custom ones
    * ffmpeg - Dispatcharr will proxy streams via ffmpeg. No transcoding takes place with the default ffmpeg stream profile, it will just remux streams. Uses more system resources than proxy
    * Proxy - Proxies the original streams, allowing you to use Dispatcharr features (redundant streams per channel), and adds a slight buffer to help with stream stability. Uses fewer system resources than ffmpeg. 
        
        !!! note
            Proxy falls back to the ffmpeg default stream profile if the source stream is not mpegts
            
    * Redirect - Redirects the original M3U stream URL to your client. There is no proxying with this profile
    * streamlink - For custom streams based on the services supported by [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/)
	* VLC - Dispatcharr will proxy streams via VLC. No transcoding takes place with the default VLC stream profile, it will just remux streams. Uses more system resources than proxy
* Custom Stream Profiles - create your own custom stream profile by clicking the "Add Stream Profile" button on the Settings page
    * Name - a name for your stream profile
	* Command - FFmpeg, Streamlink, VLC, yt-dlp, or Custom
    * Custom Command (only for Custom) - Enter the executable name (e.g. ffmpeg) or full path (e.g. /usr/local/bin/mycmd)
	* Parameters - Set your custom [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html), [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/cli.html), [VLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help/), or [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#output-template) parameters
	* User-Agent - Set the default user-agent for this stream profile
	
#### Network Access
Allows you to restrict access to Dispatcharr by CIDR range. You may enter multiple CIDR ranges separated by commas. 0.0.0.0/0 allows all IPs
!!! example
    | CIDR Range     | Number of IPs | Range example                 |
	| -------------- | :-----------: | ----------------------------- |
	| 192.168.1.0/32 | 1             | 192.168.1.0 (single IP)       |
	| 192.168.1.0/24 | 256           | 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255   |
	| 192.168.1.0/16 | 65,536        | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 |
	
* M3U / EPG Endpoints - Limit access to M3U, EPG, and HDHR URLs (default setting allows access on local networks only)
* Stream Endpoints - Limit network access to stream URLs, including XC stream URLs
* XC API - Limit access to the XC API
* UI - Limit access to the Dispatcharr UI 
	
!!! tip
    To block access entirely for any of the above, use the address `127.0.0.1/32` (do NOT use for UI!)
    
    
#### Proxy Settings
These settings affect all stream profiles with the exception of redirect

* Buffering Timeout - Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for buffering before switching streams
* Buffering Speed - Speed threshold below which buffering is detected (1.0 = normal speed)
* Buffer Chunk TTL - Time-to-live for buffer chunks in seconds (how long stream data is cached)
* Channel Shutdown Delay - Delay in seconds before shutting down a channel after last client disconnects
* Channel Initialization Grace Period - Grace period in seconds during channel initialization 

#### Backup & Restore
Create, schedule, and restore backups

* Schedule backups - Enable to set a regular backup schedule
* Advanced (Cron Expression) - Enable to set a cron expression for scheduled backups. Cron expressions allow for more granular control over backup schedules.  

    !!! examples
        `0 3 * * *` - Every day at 3:00 AM  
        `0 2 * * 0` - Every Sunday at 2:00 AM  
        `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours  
        `30 14 1 * *` - 1st of every month at 2:30 PM  
        
* Retention - The number of backups to keep. The oldest backup will be deleted when a new backup is created that exceeds this number. Set as 0 to retain all old backups.  

---

## Notifications <i data-lucide="bell" style="color: White; width: 20px;"></i>
* Real-time notifications for system events and alerts
* Per-user notification management and dismissal
* Update check on startup and every 24 hours to notify users of available versions
* Automatic cleanup of expired notifications

### Hardware Acceleration 
- Dispatcharr does not currently support hardware acceleration directly, but you can use hardware acceleration with custom ffmpeg stream profiles. 
- This will require mapping your hardware to the container and setting up a custom ffmpeg stream profile. 

#### Mapping Hardware
=== "NVIDIA"
    - Install the [NVIDIA Container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
    - Add a deploy section to your docker-compose.yml
	??? example
	    ```
		services:
		  dispatcharr:
			# build:
			#   context: .
			#   dockerfile: Dockerfile
			image: ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
			container_name: dispatcharr
			ports:
			  - 9191:9191
			volumes:
			  - dispatcharr_data:/data
			environment:
			  - DISPATCHARR_ENV=aio
			  - REDIS_HOST=localhost
			  - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
			deploy:
			  resources:
				reservations:
				  devices:
					- driver: nvidia
					  count: all
					  capabilities: [gpu]
		volumes:
		  dispatcharr_data:
		```

=== "Intel"  
    - Add a devices section to your docker-compose.yml
	??? example
	    ```
		services:
		  dispatcharr:
			# build:
			#   context: .
			#   dockerfile: Dockerfile
			image: ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
			container_name: dispatcharr
			ports:
			  - 9191:9191
			volumes:
			  - dispatcharr_data:/data
			environment:
			  - DISPATCHARR_ENV=aio
			  - REDIS_HOST=localhost
			  - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
			devices:
			  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri

		volumes:
		  dispatcharr_data:
		```
		
=== "NVIDIA (Unraid)"
    - Install the NVIDIA Driver Package plugin from community apps if not already installed
    - Edit the Dispatcharr docker container in Unraid
        - Toggle Advanced View On
        - Go to Extra Parameters
            - Add `--runtime=nvidia`
        - Scroll down and click "Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device"
		    - Config Type: Variable
		    - Name: `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
			- Key: `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
			- Value: `all`

### Process Priority Configuration
Optional environment variables to adjust priority of various tasks. Lower values = higher priority. Range: -20 (highest) to 19 (lowest). Negative values require `cap_add: SYS_NICE`  

- `UWSGI_NICE_LEVEL` - Set priority for uWSGI, FFmpeg, and streaming. Default priority is 0, recommend -5 for high priority 
- `CELERY_NICE_LEVEL` - Set priority for Celery, EPG, and other background tasks. Default priority is 5 

!!! example
    ```yaml
        environment:
          - UWSGI_NICE_LEVEL=-5
          - CELERY_NICE_LEVEL=5

        cap_add:
          - SYS_NICE
    ```
 
### Reverse Proxies
#### Nginx
HTTPS config example (streams only via https, WebUI via local network and Wireguard)

??? example "Example (click to see)"
    ```nginx
    # Dispatcharr HTTPS DynuDNS
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name dispatcharr.your.domain.com;  #Adjust for your domain

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
        
        location ~ ^(/proxy/(vod|ts)/(stream|movie|episode)/.*|/player_api\.php|/xmltv\.php|/api/channels/logos/.*/cache|/api/vod/vodlogos/.*/cache/?|/(live|movie|series)/[^/]+/.*|/[^/]+/[^/]+/[0-9]+(?:\.[^/.]+)?)$
            allow all;  # Allow everyone else
            proxy_pass http://dispatcharrserver:9191;  # Adjust for your server name or IP
            proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            # CORS settings
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept';
        }

        location / {
            allow 10.0.0.0/22;  # Allow the local network, adjust for your network
            allow 10.1.0.0/24;  # Allow Wireguard, adjust for your network
            deny all;  # Deny everyone else
            proxy_pass http://dispatcharrserver:9191;  # Adjust for your server name or IP
            # WebSocket headers
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            # CORS settings
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept';
        }
    }  
    ```

!!! note "Tip"
    Even with a properly configured reverse proxy, your M3U output may be available over the internet. Follow these best practices to block standard M3U access and allow only with a specified username and password. 
	
    1. Set up your reverse proxy as shown in the [docs](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#nginx-reverse-proxy)
    2. In dispatcharr at Settings > [Network Access](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#network-access), restrict M3U / EPG Endpoints to your local network only (example: 192.168.1.0/24)
    3. Set up a user with XC password on the [Users](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#users) page if you haven't already done so
    4. Use the following m3u link format to share with your users: `https://hostname/get.php?username=XCUSERNAME&password=XCPASSWORD`
    5. And this format for epg: `https://hostname/xmltv.php?username=XCUSERNAME&password=XCPASSWORD`

#### Pangolin
* Create your resource just as you would any other in Pangolin
* If you're hosting Dispatcharr on the same VPS (if you're using a VPS) as Pangolin, be sure to set it as a local resource and use 172.XX.X.X as the IP, then enter the port. Otherwise set it up normally
* If you'd like to enable Pangolin's SSO for this resource for security, do so in the Authentication tab of your new Dispatcharr resource

To allow Dispatcharr to connect to clients when secured behind Pangolin SSO or another IdP you've added, you need to create Bypass Rules. See below for the list of rules required. Once you save the below rules, Dispatcharr's WebUI will be secured behind your SSO while apps and services will be able to connect via XC

* The "Action" will be `Bypass Auth` for all of them
* The "Match Type" will be `Path` for all of them

??? example "Bypass rules (click to see)"

    * ```/player_api.php/*```
    * ```/get.php/*```
    * ```/xmltv.php/*```
    * ```/*/*/*.ts```
    * ```/proxy/ts/stream/*```
    * ```/proxy/vod/episode/*```
    * ```/proxy/vod/movie/*```
    * ```/api/channels/logos/*/cache/```
    * ```/live/*/*```
    * ```/movie/*/*```
    * ```/series/*/*```

    **(Optional for HDHR, M3U, and/or EPG URL access, not required if using XC. If you're using HDHR, M3U, or EPG, you should further restrict it in dispatcharr's [Settings > Network Access > M3U / EPG Endpoints)](/Dispatcharr-Docs/user-guide/#network-access). Otherwise, your HDHR, M3U, and/or EPG links will be publicly accessible over the internet** 
    
    * ```/hdhr/*```
    * ```/output/m3u/*```
    * ```/output/epg/*```

* If you'd like to set up GeoBlock for any/all resources, refer to Pangolin's [official documentation](https://docs.pangolin.net/self-host/advanced/enable-geoblocking) for guidance

* Test your new setup by navigating to Dispatcharr in an incognito or private window. You should now be met with your Pangolin login dashboard when accessing the WebUI when you're not authenticated, however your clients will still be able to connect to allow streaming
